# LevelUp
A website for gamers where they can look up games and build their own profile and interact with other gamers.

Fork and clone the repo, before running npm install to install the required dependencies.
(Unfortunately, you will not be able to access the full features of the site due to not having access to our database. Please enquire if you wish to see more).

Ensure the port number within the server.js file is open. Change if necessary, then run the command node server.js OR npm run nodemon server.js to restart the server.

In your browser, open local host with the matching port number from the server.js file. This will open the website. Once we have deployed to heroku we will be able to offer a greater showcase of this application.
